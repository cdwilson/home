# The POSIX sh shell personal interactive initialization script file.
# When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, Bash looks for the
# variable ENV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value
# as the name of a file to read and execute. For more details, see
# https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html

# shellcheck shell=sh

# If an interactive shell is invoked as sh from an existing interactive bash
# shell, PROMPT_COMMAND will be inherited in the environment.  If the starship
# prompt was initialized, PROMPT_COMMAND will contain "starship_precmd" and
# you'll see an error like the following:
#
#   sh: starship_precmd: command not found
#
# Since starship doesn't support sh, and the only time this file is run is when
# the shell is invoked as sh, just unset PROMPT_COMMAND.
unset PROMPT_COMMAND
